Road Generation Pipeline (Godot 4 Forward+)

1) Segment Geometry
- Each road segment is represented by a Path3D and generated by `procedural_road_segment.gd`.
- Mesh generation samples the spline every `sample_step_meters` and builds a triangle strip.
- UVs are distance-tiled in meters to keep texel density consistent.

2) Intersections
- Use pre-authored junction scenes (T/X/roundabout) via `road_intersection_library.gd`.
- Keep procedural stitching as a secondary fallback for unusual angle/width transitions.

3) Markings
- Primary strategy: Decal projection. Use positions from `get_decal_mark_positions()` and spawn Decal nodes.
- Secondary fallback: UV2 baked markings for static assets.

4) Materials
- Apply `res://src/graphics/shaders/road_wet_asphalt.gdshader` to road surface material.
- Drive wetness from weather system with a single uniform (`wetness`).

5) Optimization
- Batch roadside props with `RoadsideMultiMeshBatch`.
- Keep road mesh chunks in a streaming grid and rebuild only dirty segments.
